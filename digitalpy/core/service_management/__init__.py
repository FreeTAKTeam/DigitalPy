"""
The Service Management component in DigitalPy is a core function designed to 
manage the lifecycle and operations of various services within the framework. 
It provides abstract capabilities for installing, deinstalling, discovering, 
starting, and stopping services, aligning with the principles set in the 
Network component for network type and communication protocols.

* Lifecycle Management:
    Installation and Deinstallation: Allows for the installation and removal 
    of services within the DigitalPy environment.
    
* Service Discovery: 
    Facilitates the discovery of available services, aiding 
    in dynamic service management and integration.
    
* Start/Stop Mechanisms: 
    Provides the ability to start and stop services 
    dynamically, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness in resource 
    management.

* Service Isolation and Association:
    Ensures each service runs in a thread and  is isolated from others, 
    Associates each service with a specific port and network type, as defined 
    in the Network component.
    Supports various data formats and protocols such as XML, JSON, Protobuf, 
    etc.

* Integration with ZManager:
    Implements a Subscriber pattern of the ZManager, allowing services to 
    subscribe to specific topics published by the Integration Manager.

* Message Handling:
    Implements a push pattern to forward received messages to the Subject 
    (Ventilator).

* Interoperability and Standardization: Ensures compatibility with different 
  network types and communication protocols, as defined in the Network 
  component. Aligns with standardized practices for service management, ensuring a 
  consistent and efficient operational environment.
