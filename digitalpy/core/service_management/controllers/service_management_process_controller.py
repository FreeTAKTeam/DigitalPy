"""
Contains the ServiceManagementProcessController 
class, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of services in the application. 
This includes starting and stopping service processes.

The class inherits from the Controller class and overrides its methods to provide specific 
functionality for service management. The start_process method is used to start a new service 
process, while the stop_process method is used to stop a running service process.

The ServiceManagementProcessController class uses the multiprocessing module to manage service 
processes,  and handles any exceptions that may occur during the start or stop operations. 
It also uses the ObjectFactory class to get instances of required objects, and the 
ServiceDescription class to describe the services to be managed.

The file also imports several other modules and classes that are used in the 
ServiceManagementProcessController class, including Request, Response, ActionMapper, Configuration, 
DigitalPyService, and SERVICE_WAIT_TIME.
