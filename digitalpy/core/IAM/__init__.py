"""supports standard authentication and authorization protocols (LDAP, WS-Federation, SAML, OAuth, etc.), for both internal and external applications, API developers and users. 

Two key aspects of securing an application are authentication and authorization. While authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, authorization means determining if the user is allowed to do what he or she is about to do. That implies that authentication is a precondition for authorization. Input validation and filtering is another aspect, which is especially important in web applications"""
