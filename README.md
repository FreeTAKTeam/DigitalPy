## Inheritable Classes for Component Implementation
* Facade (used to access the internals of any class)
    
* Default Action Mapper (overriden to expose internal routing)
    
* Controller (overriden to provide a controller responsible for a specific category of logic)

* Business Rule Controller (overriden to expose a controller which enables specific business rules to controll the calling of controller internals)
    * current implemented rule engine (https://zerosteiner.github.io/rule-engine/)
* Node (overidden for a specific model object which should be accessible by the domain controller)

* telemetry controller (a controller specifically responsible for handling the instantiation of the implemented telemetry protocols)
    * current implemented telemetry framework (https://opentelemetry.io/)

* business logic files (a json formatted document containing business rules to be implemented by the business rules controller)

* health check (an interface for a health check to be overriden by each component to expose it's health)

* metrics controller (a controller responsible for handling the instantiation of the implemented metrics protocol)
    * current implemented metrics framework (https://opentelemetry.io/)
